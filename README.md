# lambda_snapshots
Collection of scripts to automate EBS snapshots in AWS via Lambda

* The snapshots and cleanup files can be found in various forms across the web. I can't rightfully claim these as mine but have save the modified versions I personally use here.

* The tagging file is largely my own and can easily be modified for other bulk-tag use in AWS.
